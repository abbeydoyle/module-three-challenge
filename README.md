# module-three-challenge

## Description

This project was meant to create a randomized password generator with input from the User using javascript. This project reaffirmed my knowledge of basic javascript funtions, loops, and user input methods.

This randomized password generator was built with javascript, after being given the html and css files. This was done to solely focus on and demonstrate the information learned in the week 3 Basic JS Lectures.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time. -->

## Features

This page features user input for:

- alert messages
- password length
- character types including: upper and lower case letters, special characters, and numbers


<!-- If your project has a lot of features, list them here. -->

<!-- ## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer. -->

## Tests

This randomized password generator will only allow a password length of 8-128 characters. Test this out by inputting a number outside of this range.

This generator will generate a password with any character type combination. Test it out with the user input prompts.

This generator requires the user to select at least one character type. Test out this feature by choosing 'cancel' on every character type input.

<!-- Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here. -->
